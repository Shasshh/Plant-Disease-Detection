The Farming Assistant project aimed to develop a web-based solution for detecting plant diseases by analyzing images of plant leaves. The system leveraged deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify and predict diseases across 39 different classes of plant leaves.

The project was developed over the course of several months, from September 2023 to May 2024, and utilized a tech stack that included Python for scripting and data processing, PyTorch for building and training the CNN model, OpenCV for image processing, and Flask to create a user-friendly web interface.

Challenges Faced
1.Dataset Imbalance

2.Model Complexity and Overfitting

3.Image Quality and Preprocessing

4.Integration of the Model with Flask

5.Scalability and Performance


Bug Fixes

1.Memory Leaks

2.Incorrect Predictions Due to Image Preprocessing

3.Flask App Crashes on Concurrent Request

4.Slow Model Inference
